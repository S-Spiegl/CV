# Skills

Excellent communication skills
- My time running London Clay Gardens has cemented my ability to communicate with clients and suppliers, and to delegate jobs from the top down. 
- As administrator on the Arabic Aphorisms project I was responsible for delegating tasks to postdocs and PhDs on behalf of the PI, and communicating wishes/thoughts/feedback from the PI to the postdocs and PhDs and vice versa.
- I have good personal and verbal skills. During my MA, PhD and time on the Arabic Aphorisms project, I gave various talks and papers, to academic audiences, prospective students, and at the project launch.  
- As administrator on the Arabic Aphorisms project I served as liaison between the PI, team, and the wider administrative network of the University of Manchester, and external institutions and projects.  

Organised and adaptable
- I am able to operate to deadlines and to manage my workload. London Clay Gardens - planning and scheduling projects to avoid overlap or gaps between jobs, working around the British weather, managing the expectations of clients. Lots of plates need to be kept spinning. 
- As a research administrator and as a grant writer, good communication, group-coordination, and the ability to work alone and show initiative were all essential, and these skills have also proved invaluable in running my business and carrying out jobs of various different scales. 
- I successfully completed a PhD while teaching and working on the ‘Arabic Aphorisms’ project, often assuming extra duties and working overtime with regard to the latter. 
- As administrator I organised and ran international workshops, arranged travel and accommodation for visiting scholars, created purchase orders and paid invoices, booked rooms for meetings and events, liaised with the IT dept. to resolve any technical issues, and was responsible for the timesheets of the entire research team. I also took and distributed minutes for the monthly meetings, as well as maintaining the shared drive and the project website. 
- Something about the need to manage every aspect of the business and keep on top of the different plates - HMRC, various insurances, record-keeping, client-management, scheduling, tool- and vehicle-maintenance, all down to me. 

Maths
- While I don’t have a degree in a mathematical subject, running my own business, especially one that is construction based, has led me to become adept in practical maths. Every landscaping job entails careful planning and calculation to ensure that there is neither surplus nor deficit, and that the finished project will be safe, and a few millimetres can be the difference between achieving the desired outcome and wasting time and materials. Volume, load-capacity, and budget are just some of the aspects of a standard project that require careful attention to detail and a willingness to carry out regular calculations. Aside from the construction aspect of the job, it is necessary to have a clear and ergonomic approach to invoicing, record-keeping, budgeting and fiscal responsibilities to ensure that the administrative side of the business runs smoothly. 

Curious
- I have a curious mind, for which software engineering has proved the perfect cure(?? - use another word). I won’t rest until I solve a puzzle. I love learning, and I enjoy the idea that coding is a versatile, immersive and constantly changing field in which there is always more to discover.

A sharp eye for detail
- I offered proofing and editing services to my PI on the Arabic Aphorisms project, as well as on articles and for his book (give name). I also proofed, edited, collated and standardised the CVs of applicants on funding applications. All in all, I was heavily involved in approx. £1.5m grant capture, including a £1m grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC).
- My work has given me insight into how the horticultural industry can benefit from apps - links between what I do now and what I want to do

Aptitude for languages
- Prior to founding my business, my background was in academia, and involved translating from ancient and modern languages. Just as I enjoy the relationship between scripts and syntaxes found in different human languages, I’ve enjoyed seeing how coding languages complement each other.
- As well as being proficient in German and being able to speak several other languages to various degrees, I can read several other scripts, namely Greek, Cyrillic, and Hebrew.
