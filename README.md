# From MySpace to Makers (the scenic route)

Fullstack software engineer who arrived late to the coding party, but has no intention of leaving anytime soon. Coder by day, coder by night, and horticulturalist, birdwatcher, and woodturner the rest of the time. I spent a long time looking for the right industry, having worked in academia, copyediting, grant-acquisition, administration and landscaping among (sometimes literally) other fields, but I now know I'm where I'm meant to be. Having gotten my first taste of coding as a teenager, tinkering with HTML to customise a MySpace page, I largely forgot about it for several years, having fallen victim to the assumption that software development is for those who study maths or computer science, and taking a more humanities-focused route. However, at the end of 2021, I began taking online courses and rediscovered my love for coding, and decided to apply for Makers bootcamp. I have a growth mindset, and relish the opportunity to work in a field where there is constantly the opportunity for self-directed learning and to learn new things. Having completed the intensive bootcamp at Makers Academy, I want to work at a company that offers the opportunity to grow myself and also contribute to society (an ethos which I incoprorated into my final project).

# Experience/Appointments

**2016-2022**<br>
*London Clay Gardens: Founder and owner*<br>
- In 2016 I founded my own landscape gardening business, turning a profit in the first year and growing from there on out. I took on hundreds of gardens, dozens of regular clients and several large projects across London, building a loyal client base in a short space of time.

**2013-2015**<br>
*Grant Writer for the John Rylands Research Institute at the University of Manchester* 
- Copy-editor/copy-writer on several books, articles, and funding applications both for myself and for others.
- Wrote, prepared, proofed, and edited grants, and coordinated the grant-writing process in general. Also responsible for organizing meetings with prospective applicants, liaising with applicants to ensure deadlines were met, and researching potential sources of funding and bringing them to applicants’ attention.
- All in all, I was heavily involved in approx. £1.5m grant capture, including a £1m grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
- Also carried out promotional activities, such as maintaining contact with the research office to spread awareness of the Institute and writing copy to appear in research newsletters and bulletins.

**2012-2015**<br>
*Research Administrator on ‘Arabic Commentaries on the Hippocratic Aphorisms’ Project at the University of Manchester.* 

- Responsible for proofing and editing funding applications and publications for the principal investigator and other applicants.
- Gained valuable experience working as part of a team, liaising with various departments and institutions, and arranging events.

**2012-2014**<br>
*Teacher/Graduate Teaching Assistant*

- Led ten different seminar groups (amounting to over a hundred classes) over the course of two years, teaching Latin, Roman and Greek history as well as teaching crash courses in Latin and Ancient Greek for prospective students in 2011 and 2012 while also completing my PhD and working in as an administrator and grant-writer. 
- This proved helpful in the context of the course when I needed to explain concepts and principles to fellow students (since much of the course revolved around self-directed learning), as well as knowing how to provide constructive feedback when carrying out code-reviews. 


# Skills 

#### Software Specific

- During my time at Makers I have honed my abilities as a software developer, producing work in a short space of time using an agile methodology, sprints, pair-programming, mobbing, stand-ups, retros and careful diagramming. 
- A strong proponent of Test Driven Development, - expand - OOP, MVC, separation of frontend and backend... 

####  Excellent communication skills
- My time running London Clay Gardens has cemented my ability to communicate with clients and suppliers, and to delegate jobs from the top down. 
- As administrator on the Arabic Aphorisms project I was responsible for delegating tasks to postdocs and PhDs on behalf of the Principal Investigator (PI), and communicating wishes/thoughts/feedback from the PI to the postdocs and PhDs and vice versa.
- I have good personal and verbal skills. During my MA, PhD and time on the Arabic Aphorisms project, I gave various talks and papers to academic audiences, prospective students, and at the project launch. At the close of the Makers bootcamp, I delivered a joint presentation which received a very positive reception. 
- As administrator on the Arabic Aphorisms project I served as liaison between the PI, team, and the wider administrative network of the University of Manchester, and external institutions and projects.  

#### Organised and adaptable
- I am able to operate to deadlines and to manage my workload. During my time running London Clay Gardens, I had to plan and schedule projects to avoid overlap or gaps between jobs, work around the British weather, and manage the expectations of clients. Lots of plates needed to be constantly kept spinning, and I am pleased to be able to say that they remained in motion for as long as was necessary. 
- As a research administrator and as a grant writer, good communication, group-coordination, and the ability to work alone and show initiative were all essential, and these skills have also proved invaluable in running my business and carrying out jobs of various different scales. 
- I successfully completed a PhD while teaching and working on the ‘Arabic Aphorisms’ project, often assuming extra duties and working overtime with regard to the latter. 
- As administrator I organised and ran international workshops, arranged travel and accommodation for visiting scholars, created purchase orders and paid invoices, booked rooms for meetings and events, liaised with the IT dept. to resolve any technical issues, and was responsible for the timesheets of the entire research team. I also took and distributed minutes for the monthly meetings, as well as maintaining the shared drive and the project website. Ultimately, I was responsible for a lot of organisation and flexibility. 
- In running London Clay Gardens, I have had to manage every aspect of the business and keep on top of the different facets - HMRC, various insurances, record-keeping, client-management, scheduling, tool- and vehicle-maintenance etc were all my vital to a functioning business and were all my responsibility. 

#### Maths
- Running my own business, especially one that is construction based, has led me to become adept in practical maths. Every landscaping job entails careful planning and calculation to ensure that there is neither surplus nor deficit, and that the finished project will be safe, and a few millimetres can be the difference between achieving the desired outcome and wasting time and materials. Volume, load-capacity, and budget are just some of the aspects of a standard project that require careful attention to detail and a willingness to carry out regular calculations, and this perhaps one of the reasons I have taken such a shine to TDD. Aside from the construction aspect of the job, it is necessary to have a clear and ergonomic approach to invoicing, record-keeping, budgeting and fiscal responsibilities to ensure that the administrative side of the business runs smoothly, and such detail-orientation would be of use both in the context of coding and in any modern work-environment. 

#### Curious
- I have a curious mind, for which software engineering has proved the perfect outlet. I won’t rest until I solve a puzzle. I love learning, and I enjoy the idea that coding is a versatile, immersive and constantly changing field in which there is always more to discover.

#### A sharp eye for detail
- I offered proofing and editing services to my PI on the Arabic Aphorisms project, as well as on articles and for his book, *The Mirror of Health: Discovering Medicine in the Golden Age of Islam (2013)*. I also proofed, edited, collated and standardised the CVs of applicants on funding applications. 
- copy-editing = presentation, front-end, appearances matter... but also means being good at looking for errors. Cuts down on bugs and helps me when looking for them. Well-trained eye. 
- My work has given me insight into how the horticultural industry can benefit from apps - links between what I do now and what I want to do

#### Aptitude for languages
- Prior to founding my business, my background was in academia, and involved translating from ancient and modern languages. Just as I enjoy the relationship between scripts and syntaxes found in different human languages, I’ve enjoyed seeing how coding languages complement each other.
- As well as being proficient in German and being able to speak several other languages to various degrees, I can read several other scripts, namely Greek, Cyrillic, and Hebrew. 

# Education

#### Makers Academy
*March 2022 - July 2022*

- An intensive bootcamp with an emphasis on self-directed learning.
- Learned a number of new languages, frameworks and techniques in a period of 16 weeks (4 weeks part-time, 12 weeks full-time), as detailed in the table above.
Worked remotely and onsite, practising solo working, pair-programming, mobbing, and producing three main projects as a team as well as several weekend projects on my own.
- Improved my interpersonal and teamworking skills, adhering to an agile methodology and producing work to strict deadlines.
During the final project, I learned a new framework from scratch and implemented several features on my own when time was of the essence and we had to split into smaller groups. For example, having worked as part of a team to implement the sign-up route, I was responsible for defining the login route on my own, charting a path from front to back to front end, implementing encryption, and working out how to implement a dropdown menu for both sign-up and login, which I did outside of office hours so as to make sure we were able to keep to schedule. I also took on a lot of front-end responsibilities, sharing my knowledge of CSS and especially flexbox to solve some of the issues we were having.
