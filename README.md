# From MySpace to Makers (the scenic route)

Fullstack software engineer who arrived late to the coding party, but has no intention of leaving anytime soon. Coder by day, coder by night, and horticulturalist, birdwatcher, woodturner and repository of random facts the rest of the time. I spent a long time looking for the right industry, having worked in academia, copyediting, grant-acquisition, administration and landscaping among (sometimes literally) other fields, but I now know I'm where I'm meant to be. Having gotten my first taste of coding as a teenager, tinkering with HTML to customise a MySpace page, I fell victim to the assumption that software development is for those who study maths or computer science, and took a more humanities-focused route. However, in 2021, I began taking online courses and rediscovered my love for coding, and decided to apply for the <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a> intensive coding bootcamp. Having completed the course, I want to work at a company that offers the opportunity to grow myself and also contribute to society (an ethos which I incorporated into <a href="https://github.com/Farzan-I/brains-on-brioche">my final project</a>).

# Experience/Appointments

**London Clay Gardens: Founder and owner** *(2016-2022)*
- Turned a profit in the first year. Took on hundreds of gardens and several large projects, quickly building a loyal client base.
- Channeled my creativity to design and build gardens from scratch, creating visions for clients that incorporated concepts like colour theory and texture, and keeping a careful eye on changing tastes - all especially important from a front-end perspective. 
- Developed transferable skills such as using my initiative, building and maintaining client and supplier relationships, problem-solving, delegation, and working to tight deadlines. The British weather and other unknowns meant I had to remain flexible, planning and scheduling projects to avoid overlap or gaps between jobs while keeping clients happy. 
- Learned the importance of good design and careful construction, skills that have made me a careful, consistent, and assiduous coder. 
- Managed every aspect of the business such as HMRC, numerous insurances, record-keeping, client-management, scheduling, and tool- and vehicle-maintenance. I thrive when given responsibility. 
- Landscaping requires careful planning and calculation to prevent surplus or deficit, and to ensure the finished project is safe. Volume, load-capacity, and budget were just some aspects requiring attention to detail and regular calculations, and this is one of the reasons I so enjoy TDD. It was also necessary to have a clear and ergonomic approach to invoicing, record-keeping, budgeting and fiscal responsibilities to ensure that the administrative side of the business ran smoothly, and such detail-orientation is useful both in coding and in any modern work-environment. 

**University of Manchester: Grant Writer for the John Rylands Research Institute** *(2013-2015)* 
<!-- - Copy-editor/copy-writer on several books, articles, and funding applications for myself and for others.
- Wrote, prepared, proofed, and edited grants, and coordinated the grant-writing process. Also responsible for organizing meetings with prospective applicants, liaising with applicants to ensure deadlines were met, and researching potential sources of funding and bringing them to applicants’ attention. -->
- The JRRI was a recently re-established research institute aimed at promoting research using the John Rylands Library's special collections. External funding was vital to its continued existence.
- This required that I coordinate a rigid and fast-paced application process. To achieve this, I researched and discussed potential sources of funding with institute members, establishing deadlines and priorities and organising applicants to make sure that we had everything we needed from them in time. I then guided the applicants through their part in the process, as well as writing, preparing, proofing, collating and editing applications as the situation dictated.
- This resulted in approx. £1.5m in grant capture during my time there, and the Institute went on to be fully incorporated into the library.
- I also carried out promotional activities, such as maintaining contact with the research office to spread awareness of the Institute and writing copy to appear in research newsletters and bulletins.
- My experience at the JRRI demonstrates an ability to work to deadlines, coordinate others, and to work as part of a dynamic and ever-changing team. 

**University of Manchester: Research Administrator on ‘Arabic Commentaries on the Hippocratic Aphorisms’ Project** *(2012-2015)* 

- Created a website for the project, using a University of Manchester framework for research pages and taking team photos as well as providing copy. I also designed the flyer for the project launch. 
- I offered proofing and editing services to my principal investigator, on articles and for his book, *The Mirror of Health: Discovering Medicine in the Golden Age of Islam (2013)*. This attention to detail means that I am very good at looking for errors in code, cutting down on bugs, and also appreciate the importance of front-end. 
- Gained valuable experience working as part of a team, serving as a liaison between the principal investigator and his team, and often delegating tasks on his behalf. 
- Arranged international workshops and conferences, arranged travel and accommodation for visiting scholars, created purchase orders and paid invoices, booked rooms for meetings and events, liaised with the IT department to resolve technical issues, and was responsible for the timesheets of the entire research team. I also took and distributed minutes for the monthly meetings, as well as maintaining the shared drive and the project website. 
- At the same time, I also successfully completing a PhD and taught several classes, while often assuming extra duties and working overtime. 

**University of Manchester: Teacher/Graduate Teaching Assistant** *(2012-2014)*

- Led ten different seminar groups (amounting to over a hundred classes) over the course of two years, teaching Latin, Roman history and Greek history as well as crash courses in Latin and Ancient Greek for prospective students in 2011 and 2012, while also completing my PhD and working as an administrator and grant-writer. 
- I also took part in an outreach programme designed to get students from widening participation backgrounds into the University of Manchester, providing one-on-one coaching.
- This teaching and coaching experience has proved helpful at Makers when I have needed to explain concepts and principles to fellow students (since much of the course revolved around self-directed learning), as well as knowing how to provide constructive feedback when carrying out code-reviews. 

# Skills 

- I have a growth mindset, embrace problems, and relish the opportunity to work in a field where there is constantly the opportunity for self-directed learning and to learn new things. 
- I can produce work in a short space of time using an agile methodology, sprints, pair-programming, mobbing, stand-ups, retros and careful diagramming. 
- I'm a strong proponent of TDD, OOP, and the separation of front and backend. For my final project, I produced a scalable app with a microservices architecture. 
- A background in performing and giving talks and papers means that I have excellent delivery skills. At the close of the Makers bootcamp, I delivered a joint presentation which received an extremely positive reception, and can be watched <a href= "https://youtu.be/iFInzKR8BWs?t=1170">here</a>
- I am organised and adaptable, quick-thinking and solution-oriented. When I was unable to attend the Makers Careers Fair immediately after graduating, due to catching Covid-19, I networked with hiring partners via video chat on a friend's phone. [Second example here]
- I have a curious mind, for which software engineering has proved the perfect outlet. I won’t rest until I solve a puzzle. I love learning, and I enjoy the idea that coding is a versatile, immersive and constantly changing field in which there is always more to discover.

# Education

#### Makers Academy *(March 2022 - July 2022)*

- An intensive bootcamp with an emphasis on self-directed learning.
- Learned a number of new languages, frameworks and techniques in a period of 16 weeks (4 weeks part-time, 12 weeks full-time), as detailed in the table above.
- Worked remotely and onsite, practising solo working, pair-programming, mobbing, and producing three main projects as a team as well as several solo projects.
- Improved my interpersonal and teamworking skills, adhering to an agile methodology and producing work to strict deadlines.
- During the final project, I learned a new framework from scratch and implemented several features on my own when time was of the essence and we had to split into smaller groups. For example, having worked as part of a team to implement the sign-up route, I was responsible for defining the login route on my own, charting a path from front to back to front end, implementing encryption, and working out how to implement a dropdown menu for both sign-up and login, which I did outside of office hours so as to make sure we were able to keep to schedule. I also took on a lot of front-end responsibilities, sharing my knowledge of CSS and especially flexbox to solve some of the issues we were having.

#### Capel Manor College *(2015-2016)*

Level 3 Diploma in Countryside Management. (Distinction in every module) 

#### University of Manchester *(2005-2013)*
- PhD in Classics and Ancient History (2009-2013) - successfully defended
- MA in Ancient World Studies (2008-2009) - Grade: Distinction 
- BA (Hons) in Ancient History (2005-2008) - Grade: First
- Took a number of languages (some for credit, some audited): Latin, Ancient Greek, Academic German, Academic Italian. Just as I enjoy the relationship between scripts and syntaxes found in different human languages, I’ve enjoyed seeing how coding languages complement each other. As well as being proficient in German and being able to speak several other languages to various degrees, I can read several other scripts, namely Greek, Cyrillic, and Hebrew. 
- Audited a papyrology course, where we were taught to decipher a new form of a familiar language (the handwritten Ancient Greek found on these documents is very different to the printed texts we had learned from), a transition which bears some similarities to transitioning from Ruby to JavaScript to Python. 
- Received a number of awards and bursaries (see below)

# Awards and Grants
