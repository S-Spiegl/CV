# About me: 

Fullstack software engineer who arrived late to the coding party, but plans to be the last out the door. Coder by day, coder by night, and horticulturalist, birdwatcher, and woodturner the rest of the time. I spent a long time looking for the right industry, having worked in academia, copyediting, grant-acquisition, administration and landscaping among (sometimes literally) other fields, but I now know I'm where I'm meant to be. I have a growth mindset, and relish the opportunity to work in a field where there is contantly the opportunity to learn new things. Having completed the intensive bootcamp at Makers Academy, I want to work at a company that offers the opportunity to grow myself and also contribute to society (an ethos which I incoprorated into my final project).

# Experience/Appointments

**2016-2022**<br>
*London Clay Gardens: Founder and owner*<br>
- In 2016 I founded my own landscape gardening business, turning a profit in the first year and growing from there on out. I took on hundreds of gardens, dozens of regular clients and several large projects across London, building a loyal client base in a short space of time.

**2013-2015**
*Grant Writer for the John Rylands Research Institute at the University of Manchester* 
- Copy-editor/copy-writer on several books, articles, and funding applications both for myself and for others.
- Wrote, prepared, proofed, and edited grants, and coordinated the grant-writing process in general. Also responsible for organizing meetings with prospective applicants, liaising with applicants to ensure deadlines were met, and researching potential sources of funding and bringing them to applicants’ attention.
- Also carried out promotional activities, such as maintaining contact with the research office to spread awareness of the Institute and writing copy to appear in research newsletters and bulletins.

**2012-2015**
Research Administrator on ‘Arabic Commentaries on the Hippocratic Aphorisms’ Project at the University of Manchester. 

- Responsible for proofing and editing funding applications and publications for the principal investigator and other applicants.
- Gained valuable experience working as part of a team, liaising with various departments and institutions, and arranging events.

**2012-2014**
Teacher/Graduate Teaching Assistant

- Led ten different seminar groups (several dozen classes) over the course of two years, teaching Latin, Roman and Greek history as well as teaching crash courses in Latin and Ancient Greek for prospective students in 2011 and 2012 while also completing my PhD and working in as an administrator and grant-writer. 
- This proved helpful in the context of the course when I needed to explain concepts and principles to other students, since much of the course revolved around self-directed learning, as well as knowing how to provide constructive feedback when carrying out code-reviews. 


# Skills 

Software Specific

- During my time at Makers I have honed my abilities not only as a software developer but as someone who is able to produce work in a short space of time using an agile methodology, sprints, pair-programming, mobbing, stand-ups, retros and careful diagramming. 
- A strong proponent of Test Driven Development, with 

Excellent communication skills
- My time running London Clay Gardens has cemented my ability to communicate with clients and suppliers, and to delegate jobs from the top down. 
- As administrator on the Arabic Aphorisms project I was responsible for delegating tasks to postdocs and PhDs on behalf of the PI, and communicating wishes/thoughts/feedback from the PI to the postdocs and PhDs and vice versa.
- I have good personal and verbal skills. During my MA, PhD and time on the Arabic Aphorisms project, I gave various talks and papers, to academic audiences, prospective students, and at the project launch.  
- As administrator on the Arabic Aphorisms project I served as liaison between the PI, team, and the wider administrative network of the University of Manchester, and external institutions and projects.  

Organised and adaptable
- I am able to operate to deadlines and to manage my workload. London Clay Gardens - planning and scheduling projects to avoid overlap or gaps between jobs, working around the British weather, managing the expectations of clients. Lots of plates need to be constantly kept spinning, and I am pleased to be able to say that they were. 
- As a research administrator and as a grant writer, good communication, group-coordination, and the ability to work alone and show initiative were all essential, and these skills have also proved invaluable in running my business and carrying out jobs of various different scales. 
- I successfully completed a PhD while teaching and working on the ‘Arabic Aphorisms’ project, often assuming extra duties and working overtime with regard to the latter. 
- As administrator I organised and ran international workshops, arranged travel and accommodation for visiting scholars, created purchase orders and paid invoices, booked rooms for meetings and events, liaised with the IT dept. to resolve any technical issues, and was responsible for the timesheets of the entire research team. I also took and distributed minutes for the monthly meetings, as well as maintaining the shared drive and the project website. 
- Something about the need to manage every aspect of the business and keep on top of the different plates - HMRC, various insurances, record-keeping, client-management, scheduling, tool- and vehicle-maintenance, all down to me. 

Maths
- Running my own business, especially one that is construction based, has led me to become adept in practical maths. Every landscaping job entails careful planning and calculation to ensure that there is neither surplus nor deficit, and that the finished project will be safe, and a few millimetres can be the difference between achieving the desired outcome and wasting time and materials. Volume, load-capacity, and budget are just some of the aspects of a standard project that require careful attention to detail and a willingness to carry out regular calculations. Aside from the construction aspect of the job, it is necessary to have a clear and ergonomic approach to invoicing, record-keeping, budgeting and fiscal responsibilities to ensure that the administrative side of the business runs smoothly. 

Curious
- I have a curious mind, for which software engineering has proved the perfect outlet. I won’t rest until I solve a puzzle. I love learning, and I enjoy the idea that coding is a versatile, immersive and constantly changing field in which there is always more to discover.

A sharp eye for detail
- I offered proofing and editing services to my PI on the Arabic Aphorisms project, as well as on articles and for his book (give name). I also proofed, edited, collated and standardised the CVs of applicants on funding applications. All in all, I was heavily involved in approx. £1.5m grant capture, including a £1m grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC).
- My work has given me insight into how the horticultural industry can benefit from apps - links between what I do now and what I want to do

Aptitude for languages
- Prior to founding my business, my background was in academia, and involved translating from ancient and modern languages. Just as I enjoy the relationship between scripts and syntaxes found in different human languages, I’ve enjoyed seeing how coding languages complement each other.
- As well as being proficient in German and being able to speak several other languages to various degrees, I can read several other scripts, namely Greek, Cyrillic, and Hebrew.
